<p>What will be our next 50 years? I was thinking back and a lot has changed, most all of it I never predicted.</p>

<p>So, I thought it would be good to look at the past with some songs lyrics I never listened to back then, but do now.</p>

<h4 id="monster">Monster</h4>

<pre><code>[Verse 1]
Once the religious, the hunted and weary
Chasing the promise of freedom and hope
Came to this country to build a new vision
Far from the reaches of kingdom and pope

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Like good Christians some would burn the witches
Later some got slaves to gather riches

[Chorus]
But still from near and far to seek America
They came by thousands, to court the wild
But she just patiently smiled, and bore them a child
To be their spirit, and guiding light

[Verse 2]
And once the ties with the crown had been broken
Westward in saddle and wagon they went
And till the railroad linked ocean to ocean
Many the lives which had come to an end

[Pre-Chorus 2]
While we bullied, stole and bought our homeland
We began the slaughter of the red man

[Chorus]
But still from near and far to seek America
They came by thousands, to court the wild
But she just patiently smiled, and bore them a child
To be their spirit, and guiding light

[Bridge]
The blue and gray they stomped it
They kicked it just like a dog
And when the war was over
They stuffed it just like a hog

[Verse 3]
And though the past has its share of injustice
Kind was the spirit in many a way
But its protectors and friends have been sleeping
Now it's a monster and will not obey

<h4 id="suicide">Suicide</h4>

<pre><code>[Verse 1]
The spirit it was freedom and justice
And its keepers seemed generous and kind
Its leaders were supposed to serve the country
But now they won't pay it no mind

[Verse 2]
'Cause the people grew fat and got lazy
Now their vote is a meaningless joke
They babble about law and order
But it's all just an echo of what they've been told

[Chorus]
Yeah, there's a monster on the loose
It's got our heads into the noose
And it just sits there watchin'

[Verse 3]
The cities have turned into jungles
And corruption is stranglin' the land
The police force is watching the people
And the people just can't understand

[Verse 4]
We don't know how to mind our own business
'Cause the whole world's got to be just like us
Now we are fighting a war over there
No matter who's the winner, we can't pay the cost

[Chorus]
'Cause there's a monster on the loose
It's got our heads into the noose
And it just sits there, watching

<pre><code>[Chorus]
America where are you now?
Don't you care about your sons and daughters?
Don't you know we need you now
We can't fight alone against the monster

<h3 id="aug1973">Aug 1973</h3>

<pre><code>[Verse 1]
Mama told me when I was young
&quot;Come sit beside me, my only son
And listen closely to what I say
And if you do this, it'll help you some sunny day, ah yeah&quot;

[Break]
(Be a simple man)

[Verse 2]
Oh, take your time, don't live too fast
Troubles will come and they will pass
You'll find a woman, yeah, and you'll find love
And don't forget, son, there is someone up above

[Chorus]
And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me, son, if you can?

[Verse 3]
Forget your lust for the rich man's gold
All that you need is in your soul
And you can do this, oh, baby, if you try
All that I want for you, my son, is to be satisfied

[Chorus]
And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me, son, if you can?
Oh, yes, I will

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Boy, don't you worry, you'll find yourself
Follow your heart and nothing else
And you can do this, oh, baby, if you try
All that I want for you, my son, is to be satisfied

[Chorus]
And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me, son, if you can?

<h3 id="nov.1969">Nov. 1969</h3>

<pre><code>Things look bad from over here
Too much confusion and no solution
Everyone here knows your fear
You're out of touch and you try too much

Yesterday's glory won't help us today
You wanna retire?
Get out of the way

The country needs a father
Not an uncle or big brother
Someone to keep the peace at home
If we can't get together
Look out for stormy weather
Don't make me pay for your mistakes
I have to pay my own
</code></pre>
