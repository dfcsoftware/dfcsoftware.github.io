<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Everything is Waiting for You&#8221; is a poem by David Whyte that emphasizes the importance of recognizing the connections and intimacy in our surroundings, encouraging us to let go of feelings of isolation and engage with the world around us. It suggests that everything in life is ready to support and connect with us if we open ourselves to it&quot;
&#8211; New York Times : (arghhh.. where is that link..)</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="text">    Everything is waiting for you
    Your great mistake is to act the drama
    as if you were alone. As if life
    were a progressive and cunning crime
    with no witness to the tiny hidden
    transgressions. To feel abandoned is to deny
    the intimacy of your surroundings. Surely,
    even you, at times, have felt the grand array;
    the swelling presence, and the chorus, crowding
    out your solo voice. You must note
    the way the soap dish enables you,
    or the window latch grants you freedom.
    Alertness is the hidden discipline of familiarity.
    The stairs are your mentor of things
    to come, the doors have always been there
    to frighten you and invite you,
    and the tiny speaker in the phone
    is your dream-ladder to divinity.

<p>Alertness is the hidden discipline of familiarity.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="text">    Put down the weight of your aloneness and ease into the
    conversation. The kettle is singing
    even as it pours you a drink, the cooking pots
    have left their arrogant aloofness and
    seen the good in you at last. All the birds
    and creatures of the world are unutterably
    themselves. Everything is waiting for you.
