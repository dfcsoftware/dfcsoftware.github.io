<h3 id="hereareninelessonslearnedfromtheoberonprojectthatmightbeworthconsideringbyanyoneembarkingonanewsoftwaredesign:">Here are Nine Lessons Learned from the Oberon project that might be worth considering by anyone embarking on a new software design:</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>The exclusive use of a strongly typed language was the most influential factor in designing this complex system in such short time. (The manpower was a small fraction of what would typically be expended for comparably sized projects based on other languages.) Static typing (a) lets the compiler pinpoint inconsistencies before program execution; (b) lets the designer change definitions and structures with less danger of negative consequences; and (c) speeds up the improvement process, which could include changes that might not otherwise be considered feasible.</p></li>
<li><p>The most difficult design task is to find the most appropriate decomposition of the whole into a module hierarchy, minimizing function and code duplications. Oberon is highly supportive in this respect by carrying type checks over module boundaries.</p></li>
<li><p>Oberon’s type extension construct was essential for designing an extensible system wherein new modules added functionality and new object classes integrated compatibly with the existing classes or data types. Extensibility is prerequisite to keeping a system streamlined from the outset. It also permits the system to be customized to accommodate specific applications at any time, notably without access to the source code.</p></li>
<li><p>In an extensible system, the key issue is to identify those primitives that offer the most flexibility for extensions, while avoiding a proliferation of primitives.</p></li>
<li><p>The belief that complex systems require armies of designers and programmers is wrong. A system that is not understood in its entirety, or at least to significant degree of detail by a single individual, should probably not be built.</p></li>
<li><p>Communication problems grow as the size of the design team grows. Whether they are obvious or not, when communication problems predominate, the team and the project are both in deep trouble.</p></li>
<li><p>Reducing complexity and size must be the goal in every step—in system specification, design, and in detailed programming. A programmer&#8217;s competence should be judged by the ability to find simple solutions, certainly not by productivity measured in “number of lines ejected per day.” Prolific programmers contribute to certain disaster.</p></li>
<li><p>To gain experience, there is no substitute for one’s own programming effort. Organizing a team into managers, designers, programmers, analysts, and users is detrimental. All should participate (with differing degrees of emphasis) in all aspects of development. In particular, everyone—including managers—should also be product users for a time. This last measure is the best guarantee to correct mistakes and perhaps also to eliminate redundancies.</p></li>
<li><p>Programs should be written and polished until they acquire publication quality. It is infinitely more demanding to design a publishable program than one that “runs.” Programs should be written for human readers as well as for computers. If this notion contradicts certain vested interests in the commercial world, it should at least find no resistance in academia.</p></li>
