<h3 id="decide"><em>Decide</em></h3>

<p>that you are ready to do something to become healthy, happy, and thinner. Not for anyone else but yourself. Talk it over with someone who actually has willpower and can keep their weight down. Don’t tell anyone else, this is for you, not them.</p>

<h3 id="movemore"><em>Move More</em></h3>

<p>than you normally do. Find something that gets your heart’s rate going along with your enthusiasm. Start small and easy, don’t worry, have fun with it.
I went from bicycle riding ten minutes a day, to 10 + 10% = 11, then another 10% until I got up to an hour, then switched to walking. Same 10% progression, then switching to slow jogging. Eventually I signed up and finished several 1/2 marathons.</p>

<h3 id="eatless"><em>Eat Less</em></h3>

<p>calories and portions, but stay full. Several small meals help a lot, along with adding up calories. Just write down what and how much you eat on a daily basis for a week or two, then go to the U.S. Department of Agriculture web page and count them up. After a while you will know what is what. Veggies, fiber and fruit are your friends, but don’t forget to balance the proteins and water.</p>

<h3 id="measure"><em>Measure</em></h3>

<p>your progress with a scale. Every week. Write down your change and try to figure out why it works, or not. You will find the things that work, just ignore all those nasty books, people, shows, and sites. Listen to your body.</p>

<h3 id="enjoy"><em>Enjoy</em></h3>

<p>the stress relief from exercise and healthy food. Write down your stress people, places and things, and then resolve to deal with them. Stress is what you let happen to you, so you have the power to stop it. Sleep helps to loose weight and exercise make you sleep better. Happy hormones happen with hard physical work.</p>

<p>So, that&#8217;s it!</p>
