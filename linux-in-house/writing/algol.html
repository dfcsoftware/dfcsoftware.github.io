<p>Algol was once described as a <em>disease</em> caught by unsuspecting people that can last for many years. I suppose it was that for me. I first caught it in 1980 and did not lose hold of it&#8217;s grasp until 1993.</p>

<p>It was my first really great discovery since my brother&#8217;s motorcycle became to old for him and was passed on to me, for $100. How fitting that seven years later my brother once again offered me a next level change in my life.</p>

<h1 id="nightshift">Night Shift</h1>

<p>&#8220;We just hired another idiot!&#8221; sighed my brother, followed by &#8220;you could do better than the new guy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, give me a chance!&#8221; I offered right back, especially intrigued by the possibility.</p>

<p>That summer I was driving a delivery van in Dallas TX and we had just passed the 30 days over 100 degrees mark.</p>

<p>So, the afternoon shift started at 4:30 pm until after midnight, when I came on. Running batch jobs for the Hospital, printing out patient bills, accounting reports and checks. I loved it, it was interesting, a good work environment and best of all <strong>Air Conditioning</strong>.
<img src="/linux-in-house/images/B6800.jpg" alt="B6800" /></p>

<p>I started noticing the Work Flow Language (WFL), source code would print out and some of the structure caught my eye. I gained access to a programmers terminal and started writing WFL code to calculate the conversion of a 60 minute clock to the paycheck 100 unit clock in order to see what my next paycheck could be. Then I started writing a Star Trek flying text program. Variables, loops, if and then, and saving all that newly created work to disk; was just Amazing to me.</p>

<p>Not more than a couple months later I started writing, compiling and running actual Algol code. The WFL job control language was a subset of Algol so it fit like a glove.</p>

<p>Then the manager of Technical Support asked me one day, &#8220;Guess who was the most active programmer last month?&#8221; Little did I know it was me. From then on I started delivering actual working code to help run the second and third shifts.</p>

<h1 id="educationbythebook">Education by the book</h1>

<p>Donald Gregory published several Algol textbooks and a technical journal. I bought up everything he had.</p>

<p>Plus in those days one of my tasks was to update the technical bookshelf with new changes. That involved opening every three ring binder, extracting the old pages and inserting new ones. But for me it was a chance to really read each and every manual. Another gift from my brother, &#8220;Just read the manuals. Almost no one else does so you&#8217;ll have an advantage.&#8221; Oh yes!</p>

<h1 id="opensource">Open Source</h1>

<p>In the 1980&#8217;s, Burroughs computers used Algol-based languages for everything, even the operating system (MCP) was written in NEWP.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NEWP is a programming language based on ALGOL that enables you to implement system software. Its major application is the Master Control Program (MCP), and thus some features of NEWP are closely tied to the features available in the MCP and underlying hardware. <a href="https://public.support.unisys.com/aseries/docs/clearpath-mcp-20.0/88077144-024/section-000068088.html">https://public.support.unisys.com/aseries/docs/clearpath-mcp-20.0/88077144-024/section-000068088.html</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seemed only logical that the source code for everything was included in each software release. It was also routine to <em>patch</em> the MCP for local requirements, and these patches were openly shared with magnetic tape at local, regional and national Cooperative Users of Burroughs Equipment (CUBE) conferences.</p>

<p>Eventually I submitted <em>patches</em> for a Message Control System (MCS) called COMS to the developers in Mission Viejo, California using magnetic tape from Florida.</p>

<h1 id="otheralgolvariantsihaveused">Other Algol variants I have used</h1>

<ul>
<li>DCAlgol: Data Communications extensions</li>
</ul>

<p>This is really useful for time-sharing a lot of users on terminals to the system. Command AND Edit (CANDE) was the first MCS, and is used by programmers. In the early years companies wrote their own MCS, until GEMCOS, and eventually COMS were released for application support, i.e. terminal &lt;-&gt; COBOL program.</p>

<ul>
<li>DMAlgol: Database Operations extensions</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the compiler for creating the Burroughs large systems database, DMSII. Incredibly useful for writing your own low level database programs, like load/dump, and to analyze the DMSII Audit Trail. I used it to extract update or delete statements. It makes extensive use of compile-time processing.</p>

<ul>
<li>BDMSAlgol: Database Access extensions</li>
</ul>

<p>This compiler allows Algol programs to open and use a DMSII database. It includes all normal database verbs. Some applications were written with this, but most used BDMSCobol.</p>

<h1 id="featuresilike">Features I like</h1>

<ul>
<li>Compile-time processing</li>
</ul>

<p>The single tick (') denoted extra processing during the compilation phase, For instance if a data structure has seven nodes you could create seven different compiled procedures, on the fly. Heavily used building the Burroughs DMSII database software yet available for any old [DC|DM|BDMS]Algol programmer.</p>

<p>Example using DMAlgol:</p>

<pre><code>'FOR EACH STR OF DBNODE WHERE STR.TYPEF = DATASET DO
  'BEGIN
...
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>The compile-time facility is used to conditionally and iteratively compile ALGOL source data. This section describes the declaration and use of compile-time variables, compile-time identifiers, compile-time statements, an extension to the DEFINE declaration, and compiler control options that pertain to the compile-time facility. The compile-time facility is not allowed in the global part of a program.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reference: Compile-Time Facility - <a href="https://public.support.unisys.com/aseries/docs/ClearPath-MCP-21.0/86000098-519/chapter-000002156.html">https://public.support.unisys.com/aseries/docs/ClearPath-MCP-21.0/86000098-519/chapter-000002156.html</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Shared Library (with freeze-control)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the same as every other operating system, a way to have one executable accessed by several programs.</p>

<p>Freeze-control is an option to execute some code <em>after</em> becoming available for other programs. Like running background tasks. COMS is implemented using this.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>BEGIN
PROCEDURE X(A,B);
  ...                     %Procedure to be exported
PROCEDURE Y(P,Q);
  ...                     %Procedure to be exported
PROCEDURE Z;
BEGIN       %Control procedure - untyped and no parameters
  ...
  WAITANDRESET (MYSELF.EXCEPTIONEVENT);
  ...
END;
EXPORT X, Y;
...
FREEZE(CONTROL,Z);
...
END.
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>The program is made available as a server library, and control passes to a local procedure in the library called the control procedure, where execution continues. The control library changes into a temporary library when the control procedure is exited.</p>
</blockquote>

</ol>

<ul>
<li>Programdump (debug)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can call programdump to get a human readable file of your code and data, suitable for debugging.</p>

<pre><code>ON ANYFAULT, PROGRAMDUMP(ARRAYS);
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Protection from faults</li>
</ul>

<p>If your program tries to access memory beyond it&#8217;s own, you will get a programdump to help see what went wrong, before termination.</p>

<ul>
<li>Intuitive Language Constructs</li>
</ul>

<p>Probably because of the Committee focus on Algol-58, Algol-60, and Algol-68, by the time Burroughs picked it up for the large system series mainframes it was well documented, source code examples were great, and even the Algol compiler was written in Algol. That&#8217;s why I had to compile the Algol compiler twice for a new release.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>As you can see, Algol means a lot more than just syntax and systems. It was a door opener for me, both financially and intellectually.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll never forget moving into a new trailer home, 75 feet long, single-wide, with a long hallway. That hallway became my study where I poured over program listings, penciling in changes to try out once I returned to work. Perforated green-bar paper running the length of the hall, unfolded and folded; stuffed into my Gregory Algol manuals. 25 years old, with a new baby, trying to make a living.</p>

<p>I started writing this in 1985, before I saw Unix &#8216;top&#8217;. Turns out it&#8217;s basically the same, only in Algol, for Burroughs MCP. Wish I had a sample output&#8230;</p>
