<p>By Meredith May,</p>

<p>Master raconteur Garrison Keillor, whose variety show, “A Prairie Home Companion,” has been heard every weekend for the past 40 years on public radio, is coming to the Bay Area to share more stories of growing up in the Midwest.</p>

<p>Keillor, 72, will be onstage in Santa Rosa on Dec. 3 and at the Nourse theater in San Francisco on Jan. 10. From New York, he talked to The Chronicle about storytelling, getting older, and why he always wears those red sneakers.</p>

<p>Q: Were there early signs that you would one day become a storyteller?</p>

<p>A: I was a very quiet child, and because I was so quiet, people assumed that I was smart. This is an odd thing. Nowadays they would label you at the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum. I was the boy with glasses sitting at the dinner table reading a book. We grew up with the Scripture and all manner of stories from the creation story on up to the Prodigal Son and all, and I had a great-uncle who loved to carry on and tell stories. Uncle Lou would visit Saturday nights, and he’d sit there and talk and talk while we sat patiently enduring his stories.</p>

<p>This was the way it was done back then; people had a certain number of stories and repeated them. The one about watching his own house go up in flames in 1921. Or the time he put two teams of horses on the manure spreader to spread manure on Aunt Mary’s garden, and the long pole on the spreader clipped the horses on their heels and they panicked and went wild and tore across the field with our father hanging on for dear life until he leaped. The horses stopped immediately when the reins went slack.</p>

<p>Q: What is your best, and your worst, childhood memory?</p>

<p>A: The happiest was when I went out for football in the eighth grade and I took a physical, and the doctor told me I couldn’t play because I had a click in the valve of my heart. I was shocked, but I took this experience as a cue that I have to do something else that was brave, and I went to the local paper and asked if they needed someone to write up sports, knowing they didn’t have anybody. So they let me do it. So instead of sitting on the bench, I sat at the top of stands in the press box with men from the local radio station who were broadcasting the game. I sat with a tablet and a pencil and felt like royalty up there. I was a writer .</p>

<p>My worst memory is a summer when my cousin Roger, who I admired and who was 5 years older than me, drowned in a lake. I think trying to impress his girlfriend that he could swim, which he could not. As a result, my mother sent me to the YMCA to take swim lessons, which terrified me. I was afraid of water. I just simply could not do it. This was 1953, and I was 11. The boys were required at the time to take swimming lessons in the nude, and once you learned to swim, you got to wear a swimsuit. I had never been naked with strangers before, and it was traumatic. I had to lie to my mother and tell her the swimming lessons were going well, when I was skipping and going to the library instead.</p>

<p>Q: Where does the slow and deliberate oral story fit in today’s technological world?</p>

<p>A: I think it’s much harder today; I have many stories of romance and near death that are interesting to me, but I don’t find myself telling them around a dinner table or while driving with somebody in a car. I don’t take many long car trips; I usually fly, and the person who sits next to me in the plane is interested, I assume. The opportunities are just fewer. Storytelling is a piece of the culture that I grew up in that I think a person my age has an obligation to preserve and protect because I think it’s how a whole moral can be transmitted. I don’t think a world can be transmitted in brief e-mails and texts and tweets. I think one has to tell stories.</p>

<p>Q: What stories do you plan to tell in the Bay Area?</p>

<p>A: I want to talk about a couple of people in my family who were scoundrels, but who I loved when I was a boy. I was brought up by evangelical people who had very high standards. I accepted those standards, but at the same time I loved an uncle of mine who was a profligate sinner and did not try to conceal it. This was a big bridge for me to cross. I loved him for himself, not because Scripture tells us to love the sinner. He loved the same things I did: music and jokes and stories and poetry.</p>

<p>Also, I think I should talk about radio. I’ve been doing this show for 40 years, and I need to explain that.</p>

<p>Q: Explain that.</p>

<p>A: When you’ve taken up that much of people’s time, you owe it them to justify it somehow. I stuck with it because I have more to say and still do, and because I don’t think I’ve done my best.</p>

<p>Q: What is Guy Noir up to?</p>

<p>A: He is in New York; he will be pursuing his cases. I think his case this week has to do with a young woman who moved out here and is living in a cheap apartment that has her parents worried, so they send Guy Noir to see what she is up to.</p>

<p>Q: How do your stories change as you age?</p>

<p>A: I think the stories stay pretty much the same. I think that one keeps coming back for some reason to one’s formative years simply because they were formative. I tell very few stories from my 40s, 50s or 60s. Most are about back when I was a teenager and growing up in a small town of Anoka, Minn., which I call Lake Wobegon. But I keep going back to them, and my point of view changes and the easy conclusions I might have come to 10 to 15 years ago are not so easy anymore.</p>

<p>Q: What advice do you have for students about how to write a good story?</p>

<p>A: You skip the introduction, and you start in the middle. Write the introduction, but throw it away because that’s not where you want to begin. You want to tell the story in leaps and bounds. It takes a long time to learn that. And all true stories, all good stories, involve wrongdoing and darkness. Even comedy. To tell a story right, you have to be sympathetic in some basic way to all of the people in the story. You never tell a story for revenge — that would be too transparent, and the reader would not trust you then. Trust is how a story gets through to your reader or listener.</p>

<p>Q: Do you have any Bay Area haunts?</p>

<p>A: I just like to hike around the city, especially the Inner Sunset. It’s not the fanciest part of town, but to me it’s so characteristically San Francisco. I like that Judah streetcar. I like out around 17th, 18th, 19th streets — the little restaurants and coffee shops. You can cross Lincoln and into Golden Gate Park. There’s no park like it.</p>

<p>Q: Latest project?</p>

<p>A: I’m working on a Lake Wobegon screenplay that I’m hoping I can push through to completion; I’ve been working on it way too long.</p>

<p>Q: What’s with the red sneakers?</p>

<p>A: I got a pair about 20 years ago, and I’m still wearing them. &#8230; They feel like good luck to me. I started wearing red socks with them because it was at the time when I switched over to wearing a tux onstage. Now I wear a dark brown pinstripe suit. A man has to show a little bit of color. The shoes and red socks are a little flash of color.</p>

<p>Q: What haven’t I asked you?</p>

<p>A: You have not asked me, and I thank you for it, how long I am going to go on doing this thing.</p>
