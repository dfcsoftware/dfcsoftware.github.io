&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Old Irish Wishes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stretching your limbs of life to touch that first colorful ball before it rolls away, you think "If I could just reach it, stop it, hold it, that would be the  finest happiness and contentment of my day."  Then finally after much struggle it happens, and life is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another day goes by and another quest burns to ashes once accomplished. You feel an unending surge of ideas to test, filing some away, poking at others, and dismissing the easy boring ones for days when nothing comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years wash by the curtain of time when it hits you, "I've seen all this city has. There must be more to the world." Laying awake in bed a night you may wonder if other cities are so different from yours. If other people lay in waking dreams of you and your city. What is out there, over the hill, far away, past that magical state line, into the void of the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such are the thoughts of a teenage boy, trying to find out the answers for life's questions. Why am I here and what should I do with my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only on way to grasp hold of these ideas, on the handlebars of a motorcycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here now begins the saga of a 19 year old with a head full of questions and a vague plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save $500&lt;br&gt;
Pack light, but follow the Boy Scout's motto: Be Prepared&lt;br&gt;
Tune up the bike&lt;br&gt;
Take a leap of faith&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

My Mom hugged me and Dad shook my hand. It was time for this 19 year old kid to taste life outside the sanctuary of childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been living on my own for over a year, working at Florida Hardware in the warehouse and driving a delivery truck all over the city. Staying at first in an old apartment building downtown, sharing rent with a friend, I watched people yelling at each other, fighting and stealing. My motorcycle and my friend's car battery were stolen; we were devastated. Not making enough to replace them or buy insurance, we sank lower. My bike was discovered in the river by a couple of kids, they had cleaned it up and were riding it around the yard when their father intervened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That bike runs too good to be abandoned. I'm calling the police" he said. Fifty dollars to get it out of the city pound, returned a battered bike to back to me. Kawasaki 175cc purple metal-flake dirt machine. I sold it a month later for $100 and paid my Dad back the $50. My friend borrowed an old battery from his Dad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I moved out into my own one room house in the backyard of a seventy-year-old couple. She managed the finances and he played a piano. A lovely twosome whom I shared many an afternoon chatting with. My girlfriend used to wait for me to come home from work, naked on the bed. My first love, from Algebra class, she was tall and shapely, a nymphomaniac to be precise. I was her virgin and she was my soother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the bike. A friend had received a brand new 1972 Triumph Bonneville 650cc motorcycle upon his graduation from High School. Kept in a garage, it was the most beautiful bike I had ever seen. Light brown with gold accents on the gas tank. Wrap around fenders with a style the Japanese had not yet learned from the English. Dual carburetors and solid foot pegs, the twin cylinders poured on the power with the slightest twist of a hand grip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally persuaded my friend to take my Rally Sport Chevy Vega with a killer stereo in trade. Along with $200, of course. I rode it to work and back in the sun, rain, cold and dark. I started to dream that I was Peter Fonda in the movie Easy Rider. I even took a week's vacation down A1A to Miami. At 180 pounds, shoulder length hair, goatee and mustache I frightened the grumpy old tourists. I loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camping on the beach, in deserted woods and under bridges. I felt the urge. The urge to find out what the outside of this world was really like. Saving all the money I could, I became more and more rebellious. Calling in sick to work once too many, I was called into the office and fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was it. This stinking town had seen the last of me. I was going, and going far. Away from the comfort of childhood friends and memories. Away from my loving parents and the security they provided. Away as far as the eye can see and then some. I would never look back and never regretted my decision.&lt;/p&gt;

Several friends were headed to Eureka Springs Arkansas to live off the tourists and their own artistry. Another just wanted to get away like I did. As I sped down my old home road, I paused to stop by his house. Sure enough, Chuck was there with his bag packed. He hopped on the back of the bike and I struggled to turn around with the new found weight on my back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt like my front wheel would raise up and flip us over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steady as she goes, I gassed it bravely up onto Interstate 95 and headed north into Georgia and the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We quickly slipped into a steady pace with the road rushing by at our feet and the multitude of squares in their sedans. As we passed them they stared with mouths slightly open "Damn Hippies!", they would say in silent mouthings to their passengers. We kept big smiles at seventy miles per hour, nodded occasionally at the pretty ladies, shirts flapping in the wind. It was hot but we were cool. And soaking up life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon the usual late afternoon thunderstorms pelted our skins until we felt raw. Continuing on for at least twenty miles we finally stopped under a bridge. It was getting dark and the rain was insisting on staying a while. We spied a sign offering "clean comfortable rooms" at $6 per night.I pulled in around the back of the Motel and left Chuck in the rain while I idled up to the office. Dripping wet, cold and shivering I asked "Do you have a room for the night?" The little old gray haired lady looked at me and my motorcycle out front. Laying a soaked $10 bill on the counter. I accepted my change and a room key. Chuck and I flipped a coin as to who would get the hot shower first and I lost. So I went for beer and we slept like dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only 100 miles from our old homes, we took off the next morning late but determined to make some miles. Three hundred miles under our feet we were still in Georgia and the interstate bridge looked inviting after our expensive stay at the Holiday Motel. Parking the bike out of site, we carried sleeping bags up to the crevice of the bridge and settled for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we laid down we realized how hungry we were. Chuck walked up the road that passed over us and came back in about 30 minutes with a shirt full of potatoes. He proceeded to slice and dice them into tasty little raw potato sticks. We ate them, swilled down the remains of last night's warm beer and fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This ain't no Holiday Inn!" exploded the silence. We jumped up to sitting attention, "I'll be back in five minutes and if you're still here we'll take a trip to the big house." A shiny Georgia highway patrol car was screaming at us. We packed up the bike in one minute flat and were off into the morning sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drove into the night and the air began to chill. We stopped and bought a bottle of Peach Brandy. It was, after all, the "Peach State". We warmed up and rode deep into the night until we were exhausted. Stopping a Motel 6 we rented a room and proceeded to the bar to get drunk. Four Scotches later we were singing in the rain. I tried to move by bike under shelter, but did a comical jump onto it, slowly kept going, and rolled it over on the ground and my leg. Chuck couldn't stop laughing so I struggled it back onto it's kickstand. "Damn it" we went back to our room and snored the night away.&lt;/p&gt;

Eureka Springs is a popular little mountain town containing one big attraction about the story of Jesus under the open skies and a huge concrete cross. Many locals star in a nightly play during the summer months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim was one of them. He was a friend from back home that we found in the center park drawing caricatures of passer-bys. A tall thin mushroom shaped head of hair, Tim was very happy to see us and after several days alone on the road so were we. He told us where we could camp for the night and we went off down the twisty roads of Eureka Springs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our pup tent set up and the light waning, we started dinner of hot dogs and buns on the fireplace. Noticing two young ladies two sites down from us, we asked them to join us for dinner. We talked for hours until after dark. They were taking a vacation from Columbia Missouri for the weekend and we spoke of a summer of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know how it happened, but someone mentioned skinny dipping. Next thing I knew we were all running down to the pier stark naked and jumping into the cool mountain water. These Missouri women were teaching us Florida guys how to commune with nature and enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we went into town and picked up some supplies at the local co-op. Our search for Tim led us to the "Rat Shack". Five feet from the road with a back door 100 feet off the ground, the Rat Shack was perched on a cliff and filled with smoke, drink and darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while we decided to leave and I discovered my wallet missing. "Alright, I'm tearing this place apart until I find my wallet and ALL of my money!", I boomed to the sleepy occupants. People stirred and started helping to search. A blond haired girl finally came up with it. Funny, she had given me an unexpected embrace earlier. "You's better get out before my boyfriend gets here. He's very jealous", she said. I had learned my lesson about this place and was happy to oblige. She thought she was sneaky, but ended up nothing but trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We toured the city and finally found Tim at an outdoor amphitheater. He was a crowd person dressed in robes, sandals and something for sale or barter. Almost every local had at least a small time role in the story of Jesus. "A cast of thousands" as I remembered my High School teacher describing the famous movie Ben-Hur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told us "Come to the Quiet Night, a bar under the street, tonight". I know the band and they-re great".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck and I walked the nature trail up to a lookout stop and relaxed against a giant granite boulder while soaking up the view of far western Appalachian mountains at sunset. We munched out on dried fruits purchased earlier at the co-op and dozed off thinking about the girls from Missouri last night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darkness awoke us and we headed into town to the bar under the street. Our directions consisted of "Take the main road, the high one not the low one, past the park, and just where it makes a sharp turn, the brick building on the right will have a staircase going downstairs from the street". No problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eureka springs was such a small town that it could be walked from one end to the other in five minutes flat. We followed the music down under the street and paid our five bucks, for the band they told us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spied Tim along with a whole table full of folks who all turned around and motioned us to join them. We shook hands and exchanged names while a pretty young lady asked if we wanted anything to drink. "Three pitchers of Coors!" I ordered and was instantly best buddies with the whole table, if not the better half of the bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The band started up and roused the crowd quickly into a cheer. They played a strange mixture of folk, rock, blues, and country. That night as the beer and music engulfed me I realized how much of the world I had yet to experience. I had met artists, actors, vegetarians and veterans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People talked openly about sexuality and sensibility. No one even owned underwear. Happily living on a shoestring their most prized possessions were their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The band quit about 1:30am and Tim said they were all heading to the cave. Intrigued and quite intoxicated, Chuck and I followed them outside of town and down a long winding road up into the mountains by the lakes. They all parked behind small hill covered with oak trees and started walking down a small jeep trail. Not wanting to loose my only means of transportation, I dumped Chuck and putted along the trail on my bike. As we crossed the last turn of the trail, the entire lake opened up to us in the moonlight. The cave was really a fourty-foot indentation into the cliff that overlooked the valley of water. We started a fire and talked for hours until everyone slowly dropped off to sleep, one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morning sun came up from behind the mountain affording a late awakening, which was good considering the wee hours we had spent up the previous night. Only six people remained from what seemed like twenty earlier. One of the girls volunteered to cook breakfast if I would provide transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopping on the back of my bike, we found a local general store and picked up a dozen fresh eggs, onion, and half a gallon of milk. As we checked out I snagged a loaf of freshly baked bread, unsliced of course. With a toothless grin and a handful of change the cashier said "Thanks!" Funny how friendly folks are up in the mountains, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the cave we had scrambled veggie omelet sandwiches and clove tea. Chuck went off fishing while the others prepared to go over to the Play for another rehearsal and opening night's actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had rambling on my mind and told Chuck so. He knew before we started our trip that I was planning on going out west, alone. I shook hands with everyone and thanked them for their hospitality and warmth. Promising to top by on the way back, I revved up ole faithful and took off on my own. A nomad cruising the long black ribbon that led to parts unknown and friends yet to be.&lt;/p&gt;

This took me smack dab through Missouri and the thrilling rolling hills at a posted speed limit of 65mph. The Triumph handled superbly with one rider and I made many 80mph leans that sent my heart racing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late that day Columbia came across a signpost. I remembered the girls at the campground were from Columbia and the one I was with worked at the local Denny's right off the interstate. Chris was her name. I decided to take a chance and besides I was hungry and needed to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was so nice and sweet to me that I hoped to see her. I sat down and read the menu. There she was in a little blue and white striped apron with her brown hair up in a single pony tail. Her mouth opened and her face glowed. She was happy to see me! "What are you doing here?" she asked. "Going to Chicago to see a friend". "where's Chuck?" "Back at the farm in Arkansas. I'm flying solo".  She grinned and blushed. "Quick, give me your order before I get in trouble" she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't remember what I ordered, but it was sure good to see Chris again. She returned in about ten minutes with food and told me she would be getting off in fifteen, so "Eat slowly." I felt lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris had an apartment nearby where I followed her to where she changed and we were off again to see the "Mud Pits". Only this time I left my bike and drove her car. It turns out the Mud Pits was a place where highway construction crews dug up massive amounts of clay to build the local interstate over passes. Chris's car was a tiny front wheel drive older model  with manual transmission. As I sped into the opening she yelled "TURN!" and I realized we were on top of a huge hill of wet slippery red clay with a deep drop off into a lake. I panicked, turned, the car fish-tailed in a complete circle all the while slowly  going down the slippery slope into a watery demise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People were all around us, naked and screaming, covered with clay. Someone finally helped push us into a sideways direction and more people came to the rescue. We made it safely to a place with other cars and laughed our heads off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I know why Missouri calls itself the "Show Me" state. People are always stripping naked and running around in public. We jumped out of our clothes in a second and ran full speed until the ground slipped out from underneath us and slid spinning into the clear green water. We must have played for over an hour, until exhausted, we put on our clothes and went back to the apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never showered with a woman, especially one a beautiful as Chris. She had herbal soap and flowery shampoo. We scrubbed each other with a natural sponge and embraced under the spray. We dried our bodies and slid under the covers of her queen sized bed. I suddenly realized how long it had been since I slept in a bed, and fell quickly asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris went to college at the local university during the day and worked hard as a waitress at night. The next morning she asked me what my plans were and I told her I needed to find it. "Find what?" she asked. "My creative juices" I said. She said she understood. After all, she wandered about a year after High School until she found out medicine was her creative juice. "You can stay as long as you want." she told me, but I knew it was time to go. It was a tough decision, but it just didn't feel like the right time and place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I headed straight north to Chicago. Leaving a beauty for the beast. I surprised her by taking her picture before I left. It never came out.&lt;/p&gt;

Crystal Lake was a suburb in the remains of wasted farmland. I stopped at a pizza palace and phoned Paul. He answered quickly and was surprised to really hear me right down the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He showed up in a couple of minutes and we shared a pizza and times growing up in the two Cop town of Orange Park. What a change for him. He had followed his sweetheart here with her family and was working at a local auto garage. We went to his apartment after he gave me grave cautions. "Don't make any noise and hide your bike."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His room was at the top of the stairs in an old house downtown. I pushed my bike silently into the garage and placed newspapers underneath to catch any possible oil leaks. We spoke in whispers as the night grew old and passed into sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old lady who ran the apartment house lived underneath Paul and was a total grouch. I spent the morning silently checking and cleaning the points and plugs on my bike and cruising around the small town. I met Paul after work in the parking lot and we headed over to his girlfriend's house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a split level with no trees and carpet everywhere. The first time I had ever seen cable TV though. Fifty channels of stuff to keep your eyes glued to and a small 'fridge in what they called a den. Sounded like a place for lions and tigers at the zoo to me, but I guess man had a right to creature comforts too, along with the feline species. Again I was asked to stay and again I declined. The juice was not here either.&lt;/p&gt;

Into Kansas, the most boring scenery but the most rest rooms in the country so far. Every fifty miles a small oasis of humanity existed for the casual traveler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon one such stop I discovered several books I had brought. J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy "The Lord of the Rings" and started into them. A fantasy world unfolded with Frodo and the leather footed hobbit who had a life quest for the ring, of which magical powers would be bestowed to it's owner. If I stopped at one, I stopped at twenty rest areas and recoiled underneath a tree with these books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearing Colorado I ran upon two fellow Triumph bikers from Kansas City. A Tiger and a three cylinder monster, Trident. We instantly bonded with stories of mechanics and journeys. They were amazed to see someone in Kansas with Florida plates. I was happy to see another friendly biker who knew about Triumphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Headed to Denver on a two week vacation to visit old friends and a new country." they said. "You're welcome to joins us." they added. I was elated to be in the company of other bikers and we sped on into the night towards Denver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As night dew near we stopped in a small town where these folks said they knew a place to stay for free. It was an old wooden hotel in what used to be a mining town. We found a tavern where the locals went and ordered up round after round of Coors beer.  They did not sell this Colorado brew east of the Mississippi river and it was always a fascination with Florida folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With little food and a lot of ride under my feet, I quickly succumbed to sleep. My new friends found their friend, who was re-furbishing a hotel downtown. Since it was not yet opened to the public, he invited us to stay the night for free. This gut looked like Charles Bronson and led us down a narrow hallway to dimly lit rooms with gaping holes in them. Don't worry about the holes he said, I'm putting bathrooms in. Inside one lone room with a double bed, I couldn't take it anymore. I crawled up into a corner by the fireplace and went sound asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early the next morning I was awoken by the kick of a boot. At least I was alive. We ate breakfast with Charles Bronson and made tracks for Denver. We were starting to trust each other for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Night and rain came as we stayed the course of our closely knit pact. Stopping to phone their hosts, we finally made it to a small house inside the city limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man and woman met my new friends on the porch with hugs and escorted us into the garage out back. We ran down the steps into the cellar where we stood dripping wet and shivering from cold. Our hosts brought us steaming bowls of chili and frosted mugs of Coors beer. I almost wept. We stayed up late while I listened to the many stories they had about growing up together. The world was getting smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brave souls that we were, we headed out in the morning rain. Passing someone scaling a cliff-side we went up into the Rocky Mountains. In the late afternoon we collectively decided to traverse a dirt road up a small peak and find a squatter's camping ground. One mile later we exited the road into a beautiful surrounding of small trees and meadow grass. We set up our tents and cooked a fine cowboy meal of beans and franks. We stayed up after dark telling stories and roasting marshmallows on the fire. Alas, we all three crept into our tents, to sleep the night away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning was silent and crisp. I slept in all my clothes including an Air Force flight jacket. My tent was a camel special ( not the cigarette) with three sides and no floor. I untied the doorway and was aghast at the sight. Six inches of snow rested on top of my motorcycle's gas tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hey! Are you guys alive?" I yelled. Muffled laughter was my only response. "I'm making coffee" followed. I could not remember being so cold in my life. Luckily my new friends were prepared for the cold. They had full length body suits of warmth and cans of sterno. The coffee never tasted so good, and so bland. It was good for warmth but I was too numb to taste it. We packed up camp and started our bikes in the decent down the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately Triumph motorcycles have very narrow clearances between the front wheel and the fender. Doubly unfortunate the fenders are made so well that the mud from the snowy dirt clogged up my wheel and made it into a sort of ball bearing. I was the second to slide to the edge of the roadside cliff, lay down the bike and dangle over the edge of a 500 foot demise. We all took turns rescuing each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next fifty miles along beautiful mountain roads over looking gorges of granite were very raw. We had to wipe the snow off our helmet visors every two seconds and keep a steady eye on the snow covered road to avoid careening off the big one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally reaching a general store and gas station, my snow suited buddies stopped while I circled the gas pumps. My lower self had been covered only by cotton jeans for the last two hours and my knees would not straighten up to help me stop the bike. Seven circles later I slowed enough to stop and hold myself against a pole. My friends saw the dilemma, positioned the kickstand and carried me into the store. We made a collective decision to go straight south as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down from the mountains was effortless compared to our previous trials. We went from 20 degrees to 90 in less than eight hours. My friends needed to head back home and I was determined to press west. We parted near New Mexico as I plotted a course towards the Grand Canyon. The desert felt so good as it warmed my bones.&lt;/p&gt;

As night fell I reached the Grand Canyon only to find it was full. No problem, I should be able to find something somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As luck would have it I happened on a couple of girls in a tent from Los Angeles. "Could I set up a small tent and be gone in the morning?" I asked. Giggles and nods allowed me to continue. They slept in their tent and I slept in mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we ate breakfast together. The girls were heading west, like I was, and agreed to tag along together. They were fun to be with and I pretended to be their bodyguard. We drove at least eight hours taking turns following each other. Our destination was Mesa Platte. Another national park with excellent camping facilities and a view of the valley down below. They were meeting their boyfriends here and I was glad to meet more new faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough soon after we had set up camp they pulled in with a brand new pickup truck filled with a camper on back. They wasted no time in setting up a massive grill and loading it with chicken and Bar-B-Q sauce. We sat around the fire with the sun setting in the west and the smell of Bar-B-Q chicken wetting our appetites.  It was a magnificent feast and we stayed up late watching the fire die out, telling old stories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morning came too soon as I awoke from my bottomless tent, built another small fire and made some coffee. My new friends were planning on staying at least three more days, but I had the itch to get to the Pacific Coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The late night talk centered mostly around California beach scenes where they were from. I wrote "Thanks; see ya" with a blackened end of a stick from last night's cookout on one of the rocks surrounding the fireplace. Packing the bike, I putted slowly down the gravel road of the park and back onto the interstate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land looked exactly like scenes from an old western movie. Boulders jutting out of the ground and miles of flat ground covered with little shrub oaks and an occasional tall one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon the vegetation died out giving way to cactus bunches and sage brush. You could see for miles and the heat began to melt everything in sight. I stopped many times to cool down under the shelter of a covered picnic table. I broke out the next volume of J.R.R. Tolkien's Trilogy and whiled away time in the middle world of Hobbits and Gremlins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things were going just fine until I saw the sign "Next gas station 150 miles." and realized I only get 150 miles on a tank full. Of course I stopped and paid a whopping $.75 per gallon ( $.50 was normal in those days) and filled up mt canteen and stomach with water. I had long jeans and a long sleeved shirt with a small zippered v-neck. I pulled out my biking gloves and zipped the shirt all the way. It wasn't the heat that bothered me as much as the sunburn and windburn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventy five miles an hour later, a small oasis of a rest stop appeared to the side, buzzing with activity. Actually there were five cars and ten little kids chasing after a dog. I stopped, and keeping the engine running, took a long slow drink of water. I didn't risk not being able to restart the bike, although it had never given me any trouble, yet...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heat came in waves, like the gentle waves rolling in on the ocean shore, splashing your face with sensations. I found myself day-dreaming as I glanced across the desert. I could actually see the ocean on the horizon. Only the occasional passing of a car would momentarily wake me back up as I kept the throttle steady on sixty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sign came closer, so slowly that I found myself speeding up, "FUEL" it said. Hottest damn place on the earth, I thought. I slowed into the Texaco gas station and came to rest against a telephone pole. Dropping the kickstand I spied a snow cone trailer and, reaching into my pocket for change, spoke "Large Cherry" to the attendant. He gave me a furrowed brow, smiled and said "Sure!". I opened my mouth as far as I could and rested the snow cone against it until it began to drip down my sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was then that I noticed the small ring between my gloves and shirt, which was bright red and began to sting. By the time I finished my cone, just two minutes, my neck began to feel hot also. I went to the rest room ans saw what must have caused quite an initial shock to the attendant and other snow cone consumers. A dark red streak came off my mustache on both sides of my face all the way to my ears. The hot dry heat of the desert must have made my nose bleed, but it dried up so quickly I never knew it. I washed up and finally saw the red triangle on my neck where the zippered shirt had fallen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back outside I laid down for a while on a picnic table and finished another chapter in my book. Refreshed and ready to go, I filled up the gas tank and canteen again, and headed on down the road to Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;

You could see the whole city beneath you, covered with a brown fog thick a soup. I felt a twinge in the back of my throat. "How can people live in that?" I wondered. Settling down on a remote picnic table I read late into the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awakened by the daily cleanup crew, I decided to take the journey into the smog. Interstate 10 wound down into the valley and quickly became four, then six, then eight lanes. They also had these grooves carved into the pavement which made my bike shift back and forth. I saw a sign for Ventura Beach and took the exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ventura Boulevard. Home of the famous Beach Boys. I had really made it. Just another large city with people rushing about in some sort of urgent business only they knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staying in the right lane and keeping a keen eye out for the other people in steel cages who could care less about a crummy little old motorcycle. Them from the left, came a white Mustang convertible out of nowhere. I laid down the horn and braced for impact. The guy swung his head back, the top was down, and pulled back. I quickly entered a gas station parking lot and slammed the brakes to a quick halt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guy followed me in, jumped out of the convertible and began apologizing and pleading for me not to call the cops. My bike and I were fine, but I noticed a long black stripe down the right side of his white Mustang. Lucky for me the Triumph has non-folding foot pegs and my left foot was saved, less a little  wear and tear against the black rubber foot peg. I said "No problem. Just watch for us cyclists in the future." He grinned and drove away happy. More than ever I just wanted to get to the beach and relax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This beach was weird. No cars on it, so soft you sink down several inches, until the water came near and turned the white sand black. But stranger yet was the fact that hardly anyone was in the water. I had been gone from Florida over a month, but it was still August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following highway 101 north the expensive foreign cars parked along the right side of the road gave way to Fords and Chevys. The road also took an upward climb until the beach was totally out of sight. As I passed a county line the scrub brush outnumbered the vehicles, so I decided to stop a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking next to a wooden utility pole and chaining the bike, I could tell from the steep incline down that I would not be able to see my bike from the beach. I stopped at the beach store, perched on the precipice and bought a coke and hot dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While sitting nearby munching lunch, I saw what looked like squirrels popping their heads out from the rocks. I asked the hot dog guy what they were and he replied "Ground Hogs! Eat anything you throw their way. They're harmless really." Sure enough he tossed a cigarette butt down the slope and five furry bodies scrambled for it. One succeeded, took a bite, and spit it out. They disappeared as quickly as they arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a path down to the beach and several nice rocks suitable for staying the night. The whole length of the beach was only about 200 yards long before turning into giant boulders against the waves. Watching the sun set into the water I decided to go back up to the store before closing and buy a six pack of Olympia beer and settle in for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No sooner than I emptied the first can did a large fire start down at the end of the beach. I grabbed a cold one and wandered down to the large throng of people barely visible in the moonlight. It was a giant beach party of at least fifty people all laughing and partying. I heard someone ask "Who's bike is that chained to a pole from Florida?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping closer I spoke out "That's my bike. Name's Don, who are you?" "I'm Mike. You really ride that thing all the way from Florida?" Feeling a dozen eyes on me I managed a response "Yeah, but I stopped by Chicago and Denver on the way." (slight bragging here) "Cool" echoed the crowd of unknown faces. Then came the killer question "wha'ch ya gonna do out here?" Desperately searching for another coolness, the only valid response surprised even me "Party!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great whooping ensued from the gathering and I was instantly one of the bunch. Funny how this sort of thing never happened to me in Florida. The California youngsters really liked to party and socialize with new folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I settled down later on a rock while the group built a fire. "Why doesn't anyone go swimming?" I asked someone. Big eyes and a loud laugh answered "Fifty degrees in the water. This ain't Florida" "How could anyone swim in that?" I replied. "Wetsuits. Everyone has one." Curious as I was, I removed my shoes and socks, rolled up my pant legs and went to the shoreline. They weren't kidding. The water felt like ice cubes. This was totally weird. How were people supposed to enjoy the water?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time grew late and I grew tired. Retreating to my rock and backpack, I built a comfortable couch of sand and canvas, and slowly fell asleep while the party went on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hey man. Wanna get some breakfast?" It was Mike and I woke up. Must have been about nine o'clock in the morning. "Sure." grumbling and rolling out of my cocoon. The air was warm and sleeping bag hot. We We rolled up my stuff and climbed up the cliff-side to old Thumper, still chained to the telephone pole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short jaunt down several rolling downhill curves and Mike tapped me on the shoulder "Jack-in-the-Box". He pointed at the small brightly colored building. I stopped off to the side next to a row of concrete picnic tables. Ordering only a burger and cokes we sat down on the concrete benches and cut the burger in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had noticed the last twenty dollar bill in my wallet and knew that was all I had, unless I got a job. "Where's a good place to get a job?" I asked. "Right here at Jack-in-the-Crack." "My friend's making five bucks an hour." Sounded like good money, but a burger joint seemed quite revolting, especially as I winced at my breakfast. "I need to get back to Florida in three days or get a job." I spoke out loud absently minded. Mike said "I know how to get to Florida in three days on a bike with twenty bucks." "What?" I looked at him with all seriousness. "Finish this and I'll show you" was all he would say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back on the bike Mike spoke out directions from behind and I trustfully followed. Soon we were winding through the mountains and valleys overlooking extreme precipices and cliffs. This place was exactly opposite from the beach scene, but only minutes away. Rounding up behind some apartments, Mike hopped off and said "Five bucks gets you the best Hawaiian coffee, guaranteed to keep you going all the way to FLA." This was his answer and I had nothing else to think of, so I handed him my next to the last bill, leaving me with one lone Andrew Jackson and three thousand miles to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True to his word he returned in a couple of minutes and I gave him a ride to his parents house. A nice suburban neighborhood where he wanted me to drop him off on a corner and a fast goodbye left me on my own again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filling up with the usual three gallons of gas and sipping down  two spoons of Hawaiian Java in some free hot water, I headed north-east to Barstow and back out of California via interstate 40. The next forty-eight hours were a blur and blinking white line, thanks to the Java and free hot water in the truck stops.&lt;/p&gt;

Going day and night, the rolling hills of Tennessee around midnight is where it happened. I was laid down, feet on the back foot pegs, chin just inches above the gas cap, squinting through the fog of the valleys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growl of the engine simply quit. The rear wheel slowly broke loose and wanted to go right. The chain sprocket rattled. I don't know why, but I pulled in the clutch and the only sound left was wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spying an underpass I hit the brakes and stopped underneath. Swinging out the kickstand I stepped off and removed my helmet. After taking a few breaths, I returned to the bike and tried to kick the engine over. It was frozen solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exhausted from the last two days, I reached into my backpack and pulled out a sixteen ounce can of Coors beer I was saving for my friends in Jacksonville and gulped about half of it before realizing I could not remember when I had last eaten. A large truck blasted past, I threw down the beer and got mad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning the bike around I pushed it back up about seven hills and two miles before reaching the previous exit ramp and an all night gas station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice guy inside recognized my dilemma and offered a chair and plenty of talk. "See that van out there?" he pointed. "Bet you can pick it up for about $150, but don't tell'm I said so." he really wanted to help. As luck would have it, there was a KOA campground just across the interstate. As soon as the sun came up I headed for it, but not without getting the phone number of the seller of the van. Setting up a tent in the way back of the campground, I finally fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that morning banging trash cans woke me up. I washed up as well as I could and headed for the office. "I need to speak with the manager" I inquired. "Certainly, just a minute." A thin bald man appeared after a few minutes. "Can we talk on the side?" I asked. "OK." What else could he say. I told him about my bike blowing up and assured him that I could send off for some money and purchase the van across the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He knew the owner and surprised me by agreeing to help. I told him I would work for my keep and stay out of the way of the other campers. This kind soul agreed to help me out as long as I helped him. We shook hands and he took me to meet his nephew who was spending the summer. Sam was almost my age and worked as cleanup on the grounds and trash facilities. Sam and I quickly became friends and I helped him work around the area that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning I did what needed to be done. Called my parents and asked for $300 to buy the van and take my broken bike home. Quite a surprise to get a call out of the blue for them, and the obvious asking for money. The good folks who ran the campground knew the owner of the van and gave me a ride over to his house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was a young guy, about my age and was selling the van before going into the military. He accepted my offer of $250 and I picked up the money at a local Western Union. We agreed to meet the next morning and head to Nashville where his sister would notarize the title over to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night I bought a case of beer and set down by the outskirts of the campground where I was staked out and whiled away the stories with Sam. This would be my last night at the campground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next morning I met Joe, the owner of the van, at the gas station. We drove to Nashville and he signed over the van, I gave him $250 and his sister notarized the title. Downtown Nashville was cool, with its hills, government buildings and easy going traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dropped Joe off at his house and hurried back to camp. Sam helped me load my bike into the van and I said a warm goodbye to my gracious hosts. I filled up the tank with gas and counted my remaining forty bucks. I figured I had about 1000 miles to go and at 250 miles per tank was four tanks, at $10 per tank I had better not waste anything. I bought a large bag of roasted peanuts, some bread and several apples at a local grocery store. The van was great and I took it easy trying to conserve gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive to Florida afforded me time to wander over the last six weeks in time. I had started my journey full of hope and enthusiasm. With less than $500, I saw the country and found out that people are just plain people no matter where you are. Jacksonville was not very different from many other cities and towns that I had visited. I now know that I could have taken any one of these cities as my new place to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that my destiny was my own making and I felt much better about it. My thoughts wandered to fixing my bike and perhaps fixing up the van and selling it for a profit. I wondered what could have happened. The motor would not turn over, either forwards or backwards. An inspection through the spark plug entrances revealed nothing. Oh well, plenty of time to tear the motor apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped near Atlanta and had dinner of peanuts, bread and an apple at a rest stop. These rest stops had become my home for the last two months. I decided to sleep in the van that night somewhere south of Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awaking in the early morning light I began a long hot ride south on Interstate 75, the east on I-10. The most boring ride available in the piny northern woods of Florida. I knew the streets of Orange Park were calling my name. It was time for me to make something of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived at my parents house near dark and was happy to be home. They were happy to see me and I promised right away to re-pay them with the sale of the bike or van,whichever came first. I retold some of the lighter moments of my voyage. Late that night I began taking the bike apart to find the source of my troubles. After midnight, I fell asleep in the van.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I awoke to the sound of my Dad going to work and attacked the bike right away. Following the shop Triumph manual, I finally wrenched the cylinders off and fell back in shock. The left piston was fine, but the right one was missing! Simply a connecting rod existed. No wrist pin and no sign of a piston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes I did the inevitable. Extracted the motor from the frame and cracking the cases open, revealed a million shards of steel that used to be a working motor. I made an inventory of required parts and headed to the phone. As luck would have it a Triumph shop on the Southside had a bored cylinder and matching piston with rings. Total cost $75.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my Dad returned home I showed him the news. He graciously lent me the money, again, to get back going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked for the next week replacing broken parts on the bike and finally got it running. Placing an ad in the paper for $600 for the bike, I began looking for a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three days later I sold the bike, repaid my Dad and began working on the van. I painted it Forest Green with a paint brush, and built a bed and paneled the walls. I put a stereo and speakers inside it before running out of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was really time to get a job. Time had come full circle. I was back into a life of self sufficiency and creating my destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE END (of this story)&lt;/p&gt;
