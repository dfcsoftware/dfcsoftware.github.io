<a href="/linux-in-house/quest/quest.html"><b>Quest</b></a>
: <i> Stretching your limbs of life to touch that first colorful ball before it rolls away, you think &quot;If I could just reach it, stop it, hold it, that would be the  finest happiness and contentment of my day.&quot;  Then finally after much struggle it happens, and life is good. </i>

<a href="/linux-in-house/quest/long-black-ribbon.html"><b>Long-black-ribbon</b></a>
: <i> July, 1975, the Florida asphalt steamed after a mid-summer's splash of sky and the engine popped into a constant thumping, signaling the beginning of a life quest. My Mom hugged me and Dad shook my hand. It was time for this 19 year old kid to taste life outside the sanctuary of childhood. </i>
</p>
<p>
<a href="/linux-in-house/quest/georgia.html"><b>Georgia</b></a>
: <i> My plan quickly spread. Several friends were headed to Eureka Springs Arkansas to live off the tourists and their own artistry. Another just wanted to get away like I did. As I sped down my old home road, I paused to stop by his house. Sure enough, Chuck was there with his bag packed. He hopped on the back of the bike and I struggled to turn around with the new found weight on my back. </i>
</p>
<p>
<a href="/linux-in-house/quest/arkansas.html"><b>Arkansas</b></a>
: <i> Weathered travelers by now we pressed on through Tennessee and the winding roads of Arkansas. Eureka Springs is a popular little mountain town containing one big attraction about the story of Jesus under the open skies and a huge concrete cross. Many locals star in a nightly play during the summer months. </i>
</p>
<p>
<a href="/linux-in-house/quest/missouri.html"><b>Missouri</b></a>
: <i> The northern route was on my mind because a friend, Paul, lived just outside of Chicago in a small suburb called Crystal Lake. This took me smack dab through Missouri and the thrilling rolling hills at a posted speed limit of 65mph. The Triumph handled superbly with one rider and I made many 80mph leans that sent my heart racing. </i>
</p>
<p>
<a href="/linux-in-house/quest/chicago.html"><b>Chicago</b></a>
: <i> The interstate road became concrete and littered with debris. Crystal Lake was a suburb in the remains of wasted farmland. I stopped at a pizza palace and phoned Paul. He answered quickly and was surprised to really hear me right down the street. </i>
</p>
<p>
<a href="/linux-in-house/quest/denver.html"><b>Denver</b></a>
: <i> The next morning I headed &quot;West young man!&quot; Into Kansas, the most boring scenery but the most rest rooms in the country so far. Every fifty miles a small oasis of humanity existed for the casual traveler. </i>
</p>
<p>
<a href="/linux-in-house/quest/the-desert.html"><b>The-desert</b></a>
: <i> I stopped at an Indian reservation and another small rocky wayside to view the native Indian jewelry and handicrafts. As night fell I reached the Grand Canyon only to find it was full. No problem, I should be able to find something somewhere. </i>
</p>
<p>
<a href="/linux-in-house/quest/california.html"><b>California</b></a>
: <i> The sun was low when I stopped at the last rest area before LA. You could see the whole city beneath you, covered with a brown fog thick a soup. I felt a twinge in the back of my throat. &quot;How can people live in that?&quot; I wondered. Settling down on a remote picnic table I read late into the night. </i>
</p>
<p>
<a href="/linux-in-house/quest/head-east.html"><b>Head-east</b></a>
: <i> I remembered stopping for gas and water, but I could not stay in one place for more than two minutes. Going day and night, the rolling hills of Tennessee around midnight is where it happened. I was laid down, feet on the back foot pegs, chin just inches above the gas cap, squinting through the fog of the valleys. </i>
