<p>The interstate road became concrete and littered with debris. Crystal Lake was a suburb in the remains of wasted farmland. I stopped at a pizza palace and phoned Paul. He answered quickly and was surprised to really hear me right down the street.</p>

<p>He showed up in a couple of minutes and we shared a pizza and times growing up in the two Cop town of Orange Park. What a change for him. He had followed his sweetheart here with her family and was working at a local auto garage. We went to his apartment after he gave me grave cautions. &#8220;Don&#8217;t make any noise and hide your bike.&#8221;</p>

<p>His room was at the top of the stairs in an old house downtown. I pushed my bike silently into the garage and placed newspapers underneath to catch any possible oil leaks. We spoke in whispers as the night grew old and passed into sleep.</p>

<p>The old lady who ran the apartment house lived underneath Paul and was a total grouch. I spent the morning silently checking and cleaning the points and plugs on my bike and cruising around the small town. I met Paul after work in the parking lot and we headed over to his girlfriend&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>It was a split level with no trees and carpet everywhere. The first time I had ever seen cable TV though. Fifty channels of stuff to keep your eyes glued to and a small 'fridge in what they called a den. Sounded like a place for lions and tigers at the zoo to me, but I guess man had a right to creature comforts too, along with the feline species. Again I was asked to stay and again I declined. The juice was not here either.</p>
